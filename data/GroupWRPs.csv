3,"Preformative molt less than complete, prebasic molt complete, and no prealternate molts occur. This is the most common group amoung species treated here and occurs amoung the great majority of non-passerine landbirds and more than half of the passerines.","FPJ, FCJ, FPF, SPB, DCB, MFCF, MSPB"
4,"Preformative and prebasic molts complete and no prealternate molts occur. This grouping only occurs for species with complete preformative molts, within doves, pigeons, cuckoos, and a few other species amoung hummingbirds and passerines.","FPJ, FCF, FPF, MFCF, MSPB"
5,"Preformative and prebasic molts less than complete and no prealternate molts occur. This group occurs amoung most non-passerine families, all but swifts and most hummingbirds, but no passerines.","FPJ, FCJ, FPF, FCF, MFCF, SPB, SCB, TPB, DCB, DPB, TCB, MTCB, 4PB"
6,"Preformative molt less than complete, prebasic molt less than complete or complete, prealternate molt occurs in the definitive but not the first cycle. This group (undergoing the Simple Alternate Strategy; Howel et al. 2003) occurs more commonly amoung waterbirds and here has only been documented in six hummingbird species.","FPJ, FCJ, FPF, SPB, DPA, DCA, DPB, DCB, SCB, SPA, SCA, TPB"
8,"Preformative molt less than complete, prebasic molt complete, and prealternate molts occur in both first and definitive cycles. This is a fairly common group that occurs in my passerines but no non-passerine landbirds.","FPJ, FCJ, FPF, FCF, MFCF, FPA, MFPA, FCA, MFCA, SPB, MSPB, DCB, DPA, DCA, DPB, DCU, FCU"
